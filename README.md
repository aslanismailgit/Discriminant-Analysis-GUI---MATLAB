# Discriminant-Analysis-GUI---MATLAB
A GUI designed to understand basics of Discriminant Analysisi
This App is designed to carry out PCA.

- There 2 options to run:
  1. Add App file to MATLAB Apps
  2. Move all files into a folder
     Make this folder your current folder or
     Add a path of this file
     Run  DAApp.m on your command window

I wanted to create a “Discriminant Analysis Lab” kind of App so that one can see the change on a model and outputs immediately. So one can grab the rationale behind. Below parameters can be changed in this App and model parameters and success can be seen immediately.

· Inputs
  o   means of variables
  o   standard deviation of variables
  o   Linear vs Quadratic models
  o   Cost of misclassification
  o   train/test set ratio

· Outputs
  o   TP, TN, FP, FN
  o   Confusion matrix
  o   Scatter and model plot
